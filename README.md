# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Strategy - I am using an LLM

**Using Cursor IDE for all solutions**. Will ask the default claude model to solve and hold its hand and scream at it when it gets stuck. **No code will be written by me directly**. 

Some may say this is cheating or not in the spirit of the competition. It's a feature built into a modern IDE. Back in the early 2000's I was told that using intellisense to autocomplete things was "cheating" also. I have taken note that the official rules state not to use an LLM to get on the leaderboard and I'll comply with those.

For me this year, it serves as an excellent demonstration and learning experience for using the tools built into modern IDEs to solve problems. It's how I deliver faster in my day to day work, so using it here is simply helping me learn how to work smarter.

Will keep notes here as the days go on.

Notes:
- Day 3: Oops, got on the leaderboard. Will check it next time - I wasn't thinking it was that fast.
- Day 6: I'm having to start actually reading and helping it similar to a junior dev.
- Day 9: Actually did almost perfect on this one.  I just had to tell it the results of the test from part 1 and it corrected.  Part 2 was perfect.
- Day 10: First try, both parts. That's a first since day 6.
- Day 11: Second part needed told to optimize the algorithm to produce an answer in an acceptable time, which it did perfectly on the first try.
- Day 7: Part 2 was a bit slow. Told it to optimize and it did. Wow.
